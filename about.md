# Object Groups

This mod gives you the ability to group objects in the editor tabs.

## How it looks

Check [gallery.](https://github.com/RazoomGD/geode-object-groups/blob/main/gallery.md) Or just install it and open the editor :)

## Configuring groups

This mod provides a default group configuration. But is also possible to configure groups for yourself by changing a special `.json` file. You can find more info about it in [this guide](https://github.com/RazoomGD/geode-object-groups/blob/main/Configuring%20Object%20Groups.md).

## Compatibilities with other mods

Should be compatible with all other mods. But If you are using mods that also affect editor build tabs you may encounter some unexpected behavior.
