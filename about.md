# Object Groups

This mod gives you the ability to group objects in the editor tabs.

## How it looks


## Configuring groups
This mod provides a default group configuration.
But is possible to configure groups for yourself by changing a special `.json` file.
You can find more info about it in [this guide](https://github.com/RazoomGD/geode-object-groups/blob/main/Configuring%20Object%20Groups.md).

## Compatibilities with other mods
Should be compatible with all other mods. But If you are using mods that affect editor build tabs you may encounter some unexpected behavior.
