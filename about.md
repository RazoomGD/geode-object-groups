# Object Groups

This mod gives you the ability to group objects in the editor tabs.

## How it looks
Check [gallery.](https://github.com/RazoomGD/geode-object-groups/blob/main/gallery.md) Or just install it and open the editor :)

## Configuring groups
This mod provides a default group configuration. But is also possible to configure groups for yourself by changing a special `.json` file. You can find more info about it in [this guide](https://github.com/RazoomGD/geode-object-groups/blob/main/Configuring%20Object%20Groups.md).

## Compatibilities with other mods
Should be compatible with all other mods. But If you are using mods that also affect editor build tabs you may encounter some unexpected behavior.

Information on individual mods:
- Better Edit - completely compatibly
- ObjectIDDisplay - completely compatibly
- SkipEditorObjects - mod includes its functionality 

## Known issues
- After Better Edit "update popup" group buttons may become non-clickable. Solution: re-enter the editor.
